# Security

## What this repository is

An index of links and metadata, plus small example scripts. It ships no service,
collects no data, and has no runtime. The realistic risks are therefore about
what the catalog points readers _toward_.

## Reporting a problem with this repository

Open a [security advisory](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/security/advisories/new)
for anything that should not be public. Otherwise open an issue.

Things worth reporting:

- **A catalogued project that is malicious**, exfiltrates credentials, or does
  something materially different from what its description claims. This is the
  most valuable report we can receive — an index that points at something
  harmful is worse than no index.
- **A row that fabricates an API, endpoint or package name.** Fabricated
  documentation gets copied into people's code. One such case was found and
  excluded during the first build; more will exist.
- **A typosquatted package** appearing in a row's `package` field.

## Before you run anything from this catalog

Read [docs/vetting.md](docs/vetting.md). Briefly:

- Rows flagged `code-untested` were read, not executed — including this
  repository's own examples.
- Many linked projects declare no licence — rows flagged `no-license`; the
  current count is in [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md#licences).
- Some linked projects read screen contents, mailboxes or source trees by design.
- A few were created with a single commit and never touched again.

## The security point that matters most

**Do not use a probabilistic decision as a security boundary.** It is useful
defence in depth in front of a shell command, a write, a spend or a send. It is
not a permission system. An attacker chooses the input, and the vendor's own
documentation names adversarial content as a known weak spot of the model.

Anything destructive or irreversible needs a deterministic rule, a real
permission check, or a human. Several projects in this catalog get this right and
are worth copying; at least one gate deliberately fails closed.

## Workflows

The GitHub Actions workflows in this repository interpolate no
`github.event.*` value into any shell, hold read-only `contents` permission
except where Pages requires otherwise, and never write to the catalog. If you
find a path that breaks any of those, please report it.
