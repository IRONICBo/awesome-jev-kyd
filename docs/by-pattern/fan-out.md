# Speculative fan-out

<sub>[awesome-jev](../../README.md) · [中文](fan-out.zh-CN.md)</sub>

_Pack many questions — including speculative ones — into one request and let code pick what mattered._

Every catalogued example of this decision — 28 of them, official first, then rows with code, then by stars. The same rows, with caveats, are in [the index](../../README.md#speculative-fan-out); [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?p=fan-out&lang=en) can filter them further by language, primitive and kind.
