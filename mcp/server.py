"""An MCP server over the awesome-jev catalogue.

A catalogue about how agents make decisions that only humans can read is a
strange artefact. This exposes it to the agents themselves: an assistant about
to wire Jev into something can ask for examples of the exact decision it is
making, on the platform it is using, in the language it is writing.

Three design choices worth knowing:

* **Caveats are never optional.** Every result carries its flags. The point of
  this catalogue is that `not-jev`, `shadow-mode-only` and `vendor-reported`
  travel with the row; an agent that got a recommendation without them would be
  worse informed than one that read the README.
* **Results are trimmed by default.** An agent pays for every token of a tool
  result, so `search_examples` returns compact rows and `get_example` returns
  the whole thing when one row actually matters.
* **No network.** It reads the repository's own JSON, so it works offline and
  cannot disagree with the published catalogue.

Unlike the rest of this repository, this file has a dependency. Hand-rolling
stdio JSON-RPC would keep the zero-dependency streak, but a subtly broken MCP
server is worse than a dependency, and the catalogue's own CI never imports
this module — the dependency-free build pipeline is untouched.

Run:
    pip install -r mcp/requirements.txt
    python3 mcp/server.py
