"""Where the catalogue comes from, and how honest that answer is.

Installed as a package, this has no repository around it, so the three JSON
files it serves have to come from somewhere. It fetches them, and every result
the server returns says which layer answered.

That last part is the whole point. This repository's argument is that a claim
without its provenance is worth less than no claim, and a catalogue served from
a six-month-old snapshot while quietly presenting itself as current would be
making exactly the mistake it catalogues other people making.

The ladder, in order:

1. ``AWESOME_JEV_CATALOG`` — a directory holding the three files. For anyone
   testing an edit, and the escape hatch when the rest of this is in the way.
2. **A repository checkout above this file** — that is, running from source or
   an editable install, not merely being launched from inside a checkout.
   Contributors testing an edit should be served their own working tree, and
   fetching the published copy of a file they are mid-edit on would be absurd.

   Deliberately keyed on ``__file__`` rather than the working directory. MCP
   clients launch servers with whatever cwd they please, and a server whose data
   changed depending on where it happened to be started would be far worse than
   one that simply never reads the tree.
3. **The network**, conditional on the cached ETag. GitHub answers a revalidated
   request with 304 and no body, so the steady state costs three small
   round trips rather than a megabyte.
4. **The cache**, when the network fails but we have fetched before. Degraded,
   and says so.
5. **The snapshot bundled in the wheel**, when there is no cache either. This is
   the offline first run. It announces itself loudly in every result, because
   it is the one layer that can be arbitrarily old.

Nothing below layer 3 is silent. A stale answer presented as fresh is worse than
a failure.

## All three files move together

A mixed load is a correctness bug, not just untidiness: catalog.json may use a
pattern key that only exists in a newer patterns.json, and lint enforces that
relationship inside a commit. So a source either supplies all three or it is
skipped entirely, and the ladder moves on.
