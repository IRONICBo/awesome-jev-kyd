"""Act automatically above a threshold, escalate below it.

This is the pattern calibration exists for: because confidence tracks accuracy,
a threshold becomes a policy dial between throughput and error rate rather than
a guess.

The model call and the plumbing are done. The POLICY — where the thresholds sit
and what happens in between — is deliberately left to you in `decide_action`,
because it depends on what being wrong actually costs in your system, and that
is not something this file can know.

    """Turn a decision plus its confidence into what the system actually does.

    Return one of:
        ("auto",   reason)  -- route it, no human involved
        ("review", reason)  -- put it in a human queue
        ("reject", reason)  -- refuse to route; send it somewhere safe

    Things worth weighing:

    * **One threshold or two?** A single cutoff gives you auto-or-review. Two
      cutoffs let you separate "confidently right" from "confidently unroutable"
      — useful when a low-confidence answer means the taxonomy is wrong, not
      that the ticket is hard.

    * **Should the threshold depend on the queue?** Misrouting a `howto` costs
      a few minutes. Misrouting a `refund` touches money. The Inbox Zero entry
      in this catalog uses per-decision thresholds from roughly 0.3 to 0.9 for
      exactly this reason.

    * **Is `confidence` enough, or do you want the runner-up?** Two options at
      0.45/0.44 and one at 0.89 can report similar confidence in some shapes.
      `decision.probabilities` is available if the margin matters to you.

    * **What about `other`?** A confident `other` is a different signal from an
      unconfident `refund`. One means "this genuinely doesn't fit"; the other
      means "I couldn't tell". They probably deserve different handling.

    Whatever you choose, the reason string should be good enough to appear in an
    audit log — the point of a calibrated gate is being able to explain later
    why a given ticket was or was not touched by a person.
