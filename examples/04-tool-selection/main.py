"""Tool selection with an explicit way to choose nothing.

Two design points, both borrowed from patterns visible in real integrations in
the catalog:

1. **Always include a `none` option.** Without one, a closed choice must return
   *something*, so an agent with no suitable tool returns the least wrong tool
   instead of declining. The option set is the only place "do nothing" can live.

2. **Ask a separate Noul about whether a tool is needed at all.** A choice over
   tools answers "which is most suitable", which is a relative question. Whether
   this turn needs a tool is an absolute one. The vendor's own limitations doc
   makes this distinction explicitly: a Choice over options and one Noul per
   option are not the same question.

Run:
    pip install typesafe-sdk
    export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
    python main.py
