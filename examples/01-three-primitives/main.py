"""All three primitives in one request.

The state is ingested once and every question is evaluated against it in
parallel, so asking three things costs about what asking one costs plus the
question tokens. That is the property the rest of the examples build on.

Run:
    pip install typesafe-sdk
    export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
    python main.py

No key yet? The official system-one-adapter package is a drop-in replacement
backed by ordinary LLM APIs. The shapes match; the calibration does not, so do
not tune a threshold against it.
