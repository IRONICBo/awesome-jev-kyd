"""Speculative fan-out: ask more than you need, use what turned out relevant.

The state is read once and all questions are evaluated in parallel against it.
So the marginal cost of one more question is roughly its own tokens, not another
round trip. That inverts the usual instinct to ask the minimum: here you ask
everything that *might* matter in one request, and let code pick.

This example routes a browser action. It asks which operation to perform AND,
speculatively, the target for each operation it might have chosen. Only one
target gets used. The alternative — decide the operation, then make a second
call for its target — doubles the latency of every single step.

Run:
    pip install typesafe-sdk
    export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
    python main.py
